**Title:** A Structural Threshold of Solvability: From Galois' Quintic to Poincaré's Three-Body Problem

**Abstract:**
We demonstrate a unified structural analogy between the non-solvability of algebraic equations of degree five and the non-integrability of the Hamiltonian three-body problem. We argue that both phenomena are manifestations of a single underlying mechanism: the emergence of a non-solvable symmetry group. Using the Morales-Ramis theory from differential Galois theory, we provide a rigorous proof for the non-integrability of the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP) by showing that the differential Galois group of its normal variational equations around the Lagrange equilateral points is `SL(2, ℂ)`, a well-known non-solvable group. This establishes a precise mathematical bridge between algebraic obstructions (Galois) and dynamical obstructions (Poincaré), revealing a shared "structural threshold of complexity."

**1. Introduction**
*   The historical puzzle: Abel (1824) and Poincaré (1890).
*   From metaphor to structural analogy.
*   Thesis: Non-solvability/non-integrability as a consequence of non-solvable Galois groups.

**2. The Theoretical Framework: Liouville and Morales-Ramis**
*   Definition of Liouville integrability for Hamiltonian systems.
*   Introduction to Differential Galois Theory (Picard-Vessiot groups).
*   Statement of the Morales-Ramis theorem (and its converse for specific cases).

**3. Application: The Non-Integrability of the CR3BP**
*   3.1 Hamiltonian formulation of the CR3BP.
*   3.2 Selection of a periodic orbit: Lyapunov orbit at L4.
*   3.3 Derivation of the Normal Variational Equations (NVE), leading to a Hill's equation.
*   3.4 **The Differential Galois Group Calculation:**
    *   Citing **Llibre, J., & Martínez, S. (1999)**.
    *   Stating the result: The NVE's differential Galois group is `SL(2, ℂ)`.
    *   Proving that `SL(2, ℂ)` is non-solvable.

**4. Discussion: The Unified View of "Structural Break"**
*   **Algebraic Break:** `x⁵ - ... = 0` → Galois Group `S₅` (Non-solvable) → No radical solution.
*   **Dynamical Break:** CR3BP → Differential Galois Group `SL(2, ℂ)` (Non-solvable) → No Liouville integrability.
*   The numbers 5 and 3 as the first instances of this universal structural transition.

**5. Conclusion**
*   Summary of the rigorous bridge built between algebra and dynamics.
*   Implications for understanding complexity in physical systems.
*   Future directions: Extending this framework to quantum systems and field theory.
